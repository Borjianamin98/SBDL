# SBDL (Sadegh & Borjian Directmedia Layer)
A wrapper around SDL2 which make use of sdl much simpler

## Motivation
For years in Shahid Beheshti University, ITP projects was a game written using SDL library.
Since the bare SDL library is too verbose and hard for first-year students in college to use, each year TAs create their own wrapper for SDL to ease the SDL for students.
This library is the successor of `hash<Written for ITP96Fall>` and `Genio2<Written for ITP95Fall>` with great experience which we learned from those libraries.

Mohammad Sadegh Dehghan & Amin Borjian wrote this library to fulfill all the needs of a first-term student for ITP97Fall course and all upcoming ITP courses in future.
